# Luminote

*A well-designed minimal note-taking and productivity app.*

## About the App and Why I'm Building This

I was really frustrated by the current selection of productivity apps. Most of them are either bloated, require premium subscriptions, or split core features into separate tools.

**Luminote** focuses on being minimal, simple, and ready to use â€” bringing together major productivity features in one place. I'm also working on mobile and desktop versions.

## Features (For Now)

- Minimal note-taking
- Focus timer
- To-do and reminders

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Planning to use Deno
- Database: Still deciding

## Challenges Faced

*Challenges faced will go here.*
